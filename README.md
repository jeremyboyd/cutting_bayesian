# cutting_bayesian

Data are from an observational study of 759 drivers navigating all-way stop intersections across Southern California. The dependent variable was whether or not drivers cut--i.e., failed to wait their turn in the queue that forms at intersections. The main independent variable was driver wealth, which was estimated by judging the value of their car on a 1-5 scale.
