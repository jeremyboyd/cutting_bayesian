# cutting_bayesian

Data are from an observational study of 759 drivers navigating all-way stop intersections across Southern California. The dependent variable was whether drivers cut--i.e., whether or not they waited their turn in the queue that forms at such intersections before proceeding through. The main independent variable was driver wealth, which was estimated by judging the value of their vehicle on a 1-5 scale.

Data were analyzed in a series of Bayesian hierarchical models fit using the brms package in R. Results show that drivers of higher value cars were more likely to cut than drivers of lower value cars.
